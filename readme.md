# Obfustopia Deobfuscator

This deobfuscator is designed to break the obfuscation implemented in [gausslabs/obfustopia](https://github.com/gausslabs/obfustopia).

[Breaking the $10,000 iO Bounty: My Journey to Crack an Indistinguishability Obfuscation Implementation](https://mirror.xyz/killaridev.eth/x2x6yFhovUQJxICCM8jJ7ezcjIvqyRN1iQfsWCG_Doc)

## Installation

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm ci
```

## Usage

Run the deobfuscator with the following command:

```bash
npm run optimize data/latest.json data/obfuscated.json
```

This will read circuit `data/latest.json` in. If the file does not exist, it copies the `data\obfuscated.json` to its place and starts to operate.

The process creates a checkpoint file periodically and also saves the most recent version to the `data/latest.json`. You can exit from the program and run the command again to restart. The optimizer runs forever, so you need to exit from program with "ctrl c".
